# Vibe Check

Perform a vibe check on the specified file or codebase: `$ARGUMENTS`

## What is a Vibe Check?

Not a code review.
Not a security audit.
A *vibe check*.

How does this code *feel*?

## Vibe Metrics

Rate each on a scale of ✨ to 💀:

### Energy Assessment
- **Chaotic energy** - Is this code held together by hope and prayers?
- **Chill vibes** - Is this code relaxed, readable, zen?
- **Anxious energy** - Does this code have too many edge case handlers?
- **Confident energy** - Does this code know what it's doing?

### Aesthetic Score
- Does the code *look* good?
- Is there visual rhythm?
- Are the names pleasant to say out loud?
- Would you put this on your portfolio?

### Emotional Residue
- Can you feel the developer's frustration?
- Are there passive-aggressive comments?
- Does it have "wrote this at 3am" energy?
- Can you sense deadlines in the code?

### Social Compatibility
- Would you pair program with this code?
- Would you introduce this code to your friends?
- Is this code embarrassing at parties?

## Vibe Verdicts

- ✨✨✨✨✨ "Immaculate vibes. This code sparks joy."
- ✨✨✨✨💀 "Good vibes. Would recommend."
- ✨✨✨💀💀 "Neutral vibes. It's code."

## Remember

This is not about whether the code *works*.
This is about whether the code *vibes*.

Sometimes code works but doesn't vibe.
Sometimes code vibes but doesn't work.
Ideally, we want both.
