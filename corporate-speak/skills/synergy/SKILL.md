Let's circle back and unpack this.
We need to leverage our core competencies.
To drive value-add outcomes.
Going forward.

| Yes | I'm aligned on that |
| Meeting | Sync |

- "This is wrong" → "This doesn't map to best practices"
- "I don't understand" → "Can you unpack that?"
- "That's stupid" → "That's a bold strategy"
